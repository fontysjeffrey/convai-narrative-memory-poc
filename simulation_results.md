God, I'm still annoyed about this morning's train. The 8:47 to Amsterdam - you know, the one I always take? We're sitting there, I'm trying to read this fascinating article about AI bias in hiring systems, when suddenly the conductor comes on: 'Ladies and gentlemen, due to a signal failure ahead, we'll have a 15-minute delay.' Fifteen minutes! I kept checking my phone, thinking about my 10 AM meeting with the board. My coffee was getting cold, and I could feel that familiar knot in my stomach...

Yesterday's commute was such a mess. I was on my usual morning train, reading something interesting - I think it was about AI ethics? Anyway, we got delayed for like fifteen minutes because of some signal problem. Really threw off my whole morning schedule. I hate how these little disruptions can completely derail your day, you know?

Last week I had one of those typical commuter nightmares - train delays right when you need to be somewhere important. I was trying to read, but couldn't focus because we were just sitting there waiting. It's funny how these small frustrations can stick with you longer than they should.

I remember once being on a train that got delayed, and it struck me how these moments of forced stillness can actually be gifts. There I was, irritated about being late, but also deeply absorbed in what I was reading. It made me realize how rarely we just... sit with our thoughts anymore.
