# A Comprehensive Guide to Project Planning with Project-Driven Creation (PMC)

## Introduction to Project-Driven Creation (PMC)

Project-Driven Creation (PMC), or _Projectmatig Creëren_ in Dutch, is a holistic project management methodology that originated in the Netherlands. It is more than just a set of tools and techniques; it is a philosophy that emphasizes the human element in project success. PMC provides a framework for navigating the complexities of projects by integrating the 'hard' aspects of project management (like planning and control) with the 'soft' aspects (like leadership, teamwork, and stakeholder engagement).

The core idea behind PMC is that successful projects are not just about managing tasks, resources, and timelines. They are about creating something new, and this creative process is driven by people. Therefore, the methodology places a strong emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of individuals, the dynamics of the project team, and the relationship with the project's environment.

At the heart of the PMC methodology is the **Creation Lemniscate**, a model that visualizes the four interconnected domains of project work. This model helps project managers and teams to maintain a balanced focus on all critical aspects of the project, ensuring that no single area is neglected.

## The Creation Lemniscate: The Core of PMC

The Creation Lemniscate is the central model in the PMC methodology. It represents the continuous, dynamic interplay of four key domains that are essential for project success. The lemniscate, or infinity symbol, signifies that these domains are not separate, but are interconnected and influence each other throughout the project lifecycle. A successful project requires a balanced focus on all four domains.

The four domains of the Creation Lemniscate are:

- **I - Leadership:**
  This domain focuses on the individual. It's about personal leadership, ownership, and responsibility. Every person involved in the project, not just the project manager, is expected to show leadership within their role. This includes taking initiative, being accountable for one's tasks, and actively contributing to the project's success.

- **WE - Collaboration:**
  This domain is about the project team. It emphasizes the importance of effective teamwork, open communication, and a shared sense of purpose. A successful project team is more than just a group of individuals; it's a cohesive unit that works together to achieve a common goal.

- **IT - Structure:**
  This domain deals with the 'hard' side of project management. It includes all the tools, techniques, and processes that are used to plan, execute, and control the project. This includes things like the project plan, the budget, the schedule, and the risk management plan.

- **THEY - Environment:**
  This domain is about the project's context. It includes all the stakeholders who are not part of the project team but have an interest in the project. This includes the client, the end-users, and any other parties who may be affected by the project. Effective stakeholder management is crucial for project success.

The Creation Lemniscate is a powerful tool for project managers and teams. It helps them to maintain a holistic view of the project and to ensure that they are paying attention to all the factors that are critical for success. By continuously moving through the four domains of the lemniscate, project teams can ensure that they are creating a project that is not only well-managed but also meets the needs of its stakeholders and is delivered by a motivated and effective team.

## The PMC Project Planning Process

Project planning in the PMC methodology is not a one-time event, but a continuous process that evolves throughout the project lifecycle. It is a collaborative effort that involves the project team, the client, and other key stakeholders. The goal is to create a realistic and achievable plan that is supported by everyone involved. Throughout this process, the 'I' domain of personal leadership is crucial, as each team member is expected to take ownership of their part of the plan.

The PMC project planning process can be broken down into a series of steps, each of which builds upon the previous one. These steps are not always linear; you may need to revisit earlier steps as you learn more about the project.

### 1. Project Definition and Phasing

The first step in the PMC project planning process is to define the project and break it down into manageable phases. This is a critical step, as it lays the foundation for the rest of the project. A clear project definition ensures that everyone has the same understanding of what the project is about, what it is supposed to achieve, and what is in and out of scope.

The project definition should answer the following questions:

- **What is the project's purpose?** Why are we doing this project? What problem are we trying to solve? What opportunity are we trying to seize?
- **What is the project's goal?** What is the desired outcome of the project? What will be different when the project is finished?
- **What are the project's deliverables?** What specific products, services, or results will the project produce?
- **What are the project's boundaries?** What is included in the project and what is not? This is also known as the project's scope.

Once the project has been defined, it needs to be broken down into phases. Phasing is the process of dividing the project into a series of smaller, more manageable parts. Each phase has its own set of deliverables and a clear start and end date. Phasing makes the project more manageable and allows for regular review and decision points.

### 2. Creating the Activity Plan

Once the project has been defined and phased, the next step is to create an activity plan. The activity plan, also known as the work breakdown structure (WBS), is a hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team. It breaks down the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components called activities or tasks.

The activity plan serves several purposes:

- **It provides a detailed overview of the work to be done.** By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, the activity plan helps the project team to understand what needs to be done and how it all fits together.
- **It is the basis for estimating the project's duration and cost.** Once you have a list of all the activities, you can estimate how long each activity will take and how much it will cost. This is the basis for creating the project schedule and budget.
- **It is a tool for assigning responsibilities.** Each activity in the activity plan should be assigned to a specific person or team. This ensures that everyone knows what they are responsible for and that there is no confusion about who is supposed to do what.
- **It is a tool for tracking progress.** As the project progresses, you can track the completion of each activity. This allows you to see how the project is progressing and to identify any potential problems early on.

Creating an activity plan is a collaborative effort that should involve the entire project team. By involving the team in the planning process, you can ensure that the plan is realistic and that everyone is committed to it.

### 3. The Project Start-Up

The Project Start-Up (PSU) is a crucial event in the PMC methodology. It is a workshop or series of workshops that brings together the project team, the client, and other key stakeholders to formally kick off the project. The PSU is not just a meeting; it is a working session where the project plan is reviewed, discussed, and agreed upon.

The main purpose of the PSU is to create a shared understanding of the project and to build commitment from everyone involved. It is an opportunity to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no misunderstandings or hidden assumptions. The PSU is also a great opportunity to build team spirit and to create a positive and collaborative atmosphere for the project.

Key activities that take place during the PSU include:

- **Reviewing the project definition and scope:** The project definition and scope are reviewed to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of what the project is about and what it is supposed to achieve.
- **Reviewing the activity plan, schedule, and budget:** The project plan is reviewed in detail to ensure that it is realistic and achievable. This is an opportunity for the project team to provide their input and to raise any concerns they may have.
- **Defining roles and responsibilities:** The roles and responsibilities of each team member are clarified to ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them.
- **Agreeing on communication and reporting procedures:** The team agrees on how they will communicate with each other and with other stakeholders, and how they will report on the project's progress.
- **Identifying and assessing risks:** The team identifies potential risks and develops a plan for managing them.

The PSU is a critical success factor in the PMC methodology. By investing time and effort in a proper project start-up, you can significantly increase the chances of project success.

### 4. The Management Plan and Project Organization

After the Project Start-Up, the next step is to formalize the agreements made in a management plan and to set up the project organization. This part of the process is strongly connected to the 'IT' domain, focusing on structure and control. The management plan is a document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It is a living document that should be updated throughout the project as things change.

The management plan should include the following sections:

- **Project Governance:** This section describes the project's organizational structure, including the roles and responsibilities of the project board, the project manager, and the project team. It also describes the decision-making processes and the escalation procedures.
- **Communication Plan:** This section describes how information will be communicated within the project team and with other stakeholders. It should specify what information will be communicated, to whom, how often, and in what format.
- **Quality Plan:** This section describes how the quality of the project's deliverables will be ensured. It should specify the quality standards that will be used and the quality control activities that will be performed.
- **Risk Management Plan:** This section describes how risks will be identified, assessed, and managed. It should include a risk register that lists all identified risks, their probability and impact, and the planned response.
- **Change Management Plan:** This section describes how changes to the project's scope, schedule, or budget will be managed. It should specify the process for requesting, evaluating, and approving changes.

The project organization is the structure of the project team. It defines the roles and responsibilities of each team member and the reporting lines. A clear project organization is essential for effective communication and decision-making.

### 5. Client and Stakeholder Management

In the PMC methodology, the project's environment (the 'THEY' domain) is considered a critical success factor. This domain includes the client, end-users, and any other stakeholders who have an interest in the project. Effective management of these stakeholders is essential for ensuring that the project meets their needs and expectations.

Client and stakeholder management is not a one-time activity; it is an ongoing process that requires continuous attention throughout the project lifecycle. It involves identifying the stakeholders, understanding their needs and expectations, and developing strategies to engage and communicate with them effectively.

Key activities in client and stakeholder management include:

- **Stakeholder Identification:** The first step is to identify all the stakeholders who have an interest in the project. This includes both internal and external stakeholders. A stakeholder analysis can be used to map out the stakeholders and to understand their level of interest and influence.
- **Understanding Stakeholder Needs and Expectations:** Once the stakeholders have been identified, the next step is to understand their needs and expectations. This can be done through interviews, workshops, and other forms of communication. It is important to remember that stakeholders may have conflicting needs and expectations, and it is the project manager's job to manage these conflicts.
- **Developing a Stakeholder Engagement Strategy:** Based on the stakeholder analysis, a stakeholder engagement strategy should be developed. This strategy should define how the project team will communicate and interact with each stakeholder group. The goal is to build strong relationships with the stakeholders and to keep them engaged and supportive of the project.
- **Regular Communication:** Regular communication is key to effective stakeholder management. Stakeholders should be kept informed about the project's progress, and they should be given opportunities to provide their feedback. This can be done through regular meetings, newsletters, and other forms of communication.

By actively managing the project's environment, you can ensure that the project stays aligned with the needs of the business and that it delivers real value to the organization.

### 6. Team Composition and Development

The PMC methodology recognizes that the project team is the heart of the project. The 'WE' domain of the Creation Lemniscate emphasizes the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and a positive team spirit. A well-functioning team is more likely to be successful than a group of individuals who are not working together effectively.

Building a successful project team involves two key aspects: team composition and team development.

**Team Composition**

Team composition is about getting the right people on the team. This is not just about technical skills and experience; it is also about personality, attitude, and the ability to work well with others. When composing a project team, you should consider the following factors:

- **Skills and Experience:** The team should have the right mix of skills and experience to complete the project successfully. This includes both technical skills and soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership.
- **Roles and Responsibilities:** The roles and responsibilities of each team member should be clearly defined. This ensures that everyone knows what is expected of them and that there is no confusion or overlap.
- **Team Size:** The size of the team should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the project. A team that is too small may not have the resources to complete the project on time, while a team that is too large can be difficult to manage.
- **Team Diversity:** A diverse team, with a mix of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, is more likely to be innovative and creative.

**Team Development**

Team development is about helping the team to grow and mature over time. It is an ongoing process that involves building trust, improving communication, and fostering a collaborative work environment. Key activities in team development include:

- **Team Building:** Team-building activities can help to build trust and to improve communication within the team. This can include both formal and informal activities, such as team-building workshops, social events, and regular team meetings.
- **Open Communication:** A culture of open and honest communication is essential for a successful project team. Team members should feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback with each other.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Conflicts are inevitable in any team. The key is to have a process for resolving conflicts in a constructive and respectful manner.
- **Continuous Improvement:** The team should regularly reflect on its performance and look for ways to improve. This can be done through regular team retrospectives and feedback sessions.

By investing in team composition and development, you can create a high-performing project team that is motivated, engaged, and committed to project success.

### 7. Project Control

Project control, deeply rooted in the 'IT' domain, is the process of monitoring the project's progress, comparing it to the plan, and taking corrective action when necessary. In the PMC methodology, project control is not just about tracking numbers; it is about creating a learning environment where the project team can continuously improve and adapt.

Project control in PMC is based on the principle of "plan-do-check-act" (PDCA). This is a continuous cycle of planning, executing, monitoring, and adjusting. The goal is to ensure that the project stays on track and that it achieves its objectives.

Key aspects of project control in PMC include:

- **Progress Monitoring:** The project's progress is monitored on a regular basis. This includes tracking the completion of activities, the expenditure of the budget, and the achievement of milestones. Progress is reported in a clear and concise format that is easy to understand.
- **Variance Analysis:** The actual progress is compared to the planned progress to identify any variances. A variance is any deviation from the plan. Variances can be positive or negative. A positive variance means that the project is ahead of schedule or under budget, while a negative variance means that the project is behind schedule or over budget.
- **Corrective Action:** When a negative variance is identified, corrective action is taken to bring the project back on track. Corrective action can include things like re-planning, re-allocating resources, or changing the scope of the project.
- **Change Control:** Changes to the project's scope, schedule, or budget are managed through a formal change control process. This ensures that all changes are properly evaluated, approved, and documented.
- **Reporting:** The project's progress is reported to the project board and other key stakeholders on a regular basis. The reports should be clear, concise, and accurate. They should provide an overview of the project's status, including any issues, risks, or changes.

Project control is an essential part of the PMC methodology. It helps to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. It also helps to create a learning environment where the project team can continuously improve and adapt.

## Conclusion: The Power of a Holistic Approach

Project-Driven Creation (PMC) offers a powerful and comprehensive framework for project management. By moving beyond the traditional focus on tools and techniques, PMC embraces a holistic approach that recognizes the critical role of people in project success. The Creation Lemniscate, with its four domains of I, WE, IT, and THEY, provides a simple yet profound model for balancing the various forces at play in any project.

By following the PMC project planning process, from the initial project definition to the ongoing project control, you can create a project plan that is not only robust and realistic but also has the buy-in and commitment of the entire project team and its stakeholders. The emphasis on collaboration, leadership, and stakeholder engagement helps to create a positive and productive project environment where everyone is working towards a common goal.

In a world where projects are becoming increasingly complex and uncertain, the PMC methodology provides a much-needed framework for navigating the challenges of modern project management. By embracing the principles of PMC, you can increase your chances of delivering successful projects that not only meet their objectives but also create lasting value for your organization.
